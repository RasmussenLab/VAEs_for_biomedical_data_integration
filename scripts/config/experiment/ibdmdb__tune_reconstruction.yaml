# Define the default configuration for the data and task (model and training)
# Change task to "tune_model_stability" if you want to obtain stats about each model's stability

defaults:
  - override /data: ibdmdb
  - override /task: tune_model_reconstruction

# Configure which hyperarameters to vary
# This will run and log the metrics of 4 models (combination of 2 hyperparams with 2 levels: 2 * 2)

# Any field defined in the task configuration can be configured below.
