# Configs README

Configuration files are yaml files defining a number of properties of the datasets or the tasks to run. Note that config files provide baseline values, but these can be overriden "on the fly" when running MOVE. Please look at the code in ```On_the_use_of_VAEs_for_biomedical_data_integration.ipynb```for more details on the exact hyperparameters of the models.
