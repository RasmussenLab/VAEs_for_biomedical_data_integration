# Scripts

- *AMSC_MOVE.ipynb*: Main notebook of the project. It was run on a cloud environment with 8 CPUs, 52 GB of memory using Terra (Broad Institute platform).
- *MOVE_edits.ipynb*: We added small edits to MOVE's code for this particular project. This notebook keeps track of them.
- *Tutorial_VAEs_for_biomedical_data_integration.ipynb*: Notebook guiding the reader through the main findings of the project. This is done by creating a synthetic dataset and performing the analyses as done in the paper.
- *Toy_models_Elhage_et_al.ipynb*: Adaptation of the code in the colab notebook from Anthropic's paper by Elhage et al. Toy models of superposition. The notebook shows the behaviour of a simple autoencoder when compressing inputs under different correlation regimes.
