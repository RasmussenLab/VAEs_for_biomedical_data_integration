        ">**📕 Theoretical insights:** In our synthetic datasets, each sample was originally obtained as a measurement or draw from a multivariate gaussian distribution, 𝒙 ∼ 𝒩(𝜇, 𝜎), where each feature was described by one of the components of the gaussian. This relatively simple protocol enabled us to simulate different scales of possible feature values via the mean of each feature. It also allowed us to add an arbitrary number of linear associations between features by controlling the covariance matrix describing the distribution. A vector encoding the means of each feature or column and a sparse covariance matrix (sparsity defined by $α_{cov}$ = 0.99) were used to define the parameters of the multivariate random normal distribution. The dataset went subsequently through the standard preprocessing for continuous variables, which consisted in $\\log_2(1+x)$ transformation and posterior normalization to zero mean and unit variance.\n",

Finally, continuous features could be turned into binary features by setting to zero/one all values below/above the mean. Ground truth associated variables were defined to be two variables with a correlation above a predefined threshold.\n",

The input dataset $X$, a matrix with $N_{samples}$ rows and $N_{features}$ columns, served as a reference and was encoded into its latent representation $z$, with $N_{samples}$ rows and $N_{latent}$ columns.  A perturbed dataset $X’$,  where the feature of interest had been substituted in all samples for the missing value (i.e. 0), was encoded into its latent representation $z’$. The induced movement of the samples in latent space was then computed as the Euclidean distance $d$ between both encodings, i.e. $d = z’ - z$. Finally, the overall movement of each sample was obtained by adding the movements in all latent components, as a sum of all elements in each row. This protocol was repeated for each feature, one by one, and the 10 features with the largest absolute sum difference across samples were taken to be the most important ones."
